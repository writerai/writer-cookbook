    "\n",
    "The Palmyra Instruct model is already quite good at following instruction, so this task mostly boils down to sending the right prompt. Creating a prompt involves a bit of trial and error, e.g. changing the capitalization of the word \"none\" has given different results. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the first prompt I tried had a couple of issues. One is that it would give the name of a more well-known game that sounds similar or was in the same franchise. You can see where I tried to fix that in the first commented-out line. This kind of worked, but then it would respond with \"none\" sometimes when there was clearly a correct answer. Similarly, at first it would format the name of the game differently than it was in the title (e.g. Street Fighter 6 -> Street Fighter VI). This isn't a problem per se, but indicated that the model was pulling more from its prior knowledge than the input. Both of these issues were mitigated by using the word \"extract\" instead of \"output\" or \"return\", so you can see how small of a wording difference can affect the result. I also added the line about unrecognized games to account for titles that hadn't been released yet during the model's training. This works alright as far as I can tell, but it still misses some cases as I'll talk about soon."
